1) Measure complexity - combination of space taken and number of steps needed
2) Ensure grid can handle movement in any direction (recentering)
  - Cannot handle scenario where there is an item that is partial available to go off the edge
    - Handle by either expanding the grid or preventing the action
3) Using complexity and timeouts, ensure that the created puzzle matches a certain value (either passed or hardcoded)
4) Improve brute force algorithm by generating all sets of four/five from remaining results, and applying depth first solution
