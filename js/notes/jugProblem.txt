Maths nerd bit: You're looking for the smallest x and y that satisfy 3x−5y=4; then fill the 3-liter x times, pouring it into the 5-liter when full, and emptying the 5-liter when it's full (which you'll do y times). The solution is x=3 and y=1. The alternate solution up there is the dual formulation, 5x−3y=4 (x=2, y=2). From here, two details present themselves: one, that it's easily adaptable to other values other than 3 and 5, and two, that a solution exists only if the target value is either a factor or a multiple of the highest common factor of the container sizes (e.g. you can't get 4 liters from 6- and 3-liter containers).
