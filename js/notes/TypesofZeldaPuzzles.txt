Types of Zelda Puzzles
----------------------
1) Hidden wall "puzzles"
2) Kill all enemies puzzles - can work if the enemies aren't killable until item
3) Light all torches
4) Light all torches in specific order
5) Hit switches in
6) Move block
7) Shift rows using buttons to form particular pattern
8) Rotational centerpiece needing to loop around
9) Placing object on switch

Switching puzzle, but the items that you are switching yourself with are destroyed after use - careful consideration of resources

Puzzles - 
  Three parts to each puzzle - 
    1) The assumption - lead players down a false path. Misdirect them to a simple but wrong solution
    2) The catch - a contradiction between two opposing goals (e.g. enter door but cannot because you need to be on the button. Solution is to use a block on the button). Changing sequence of events or rethinking the spatial element
    3) The revelation - think outside the box

  Puzzles can also emerge from full exploration of the mechanic (look into interesting game mechanics or play around with your own in prototyping)
  No puzzle should be given in isolation - build up the complexity over a series of events
